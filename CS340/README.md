 How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

I write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable by including simple comments and understandable variables for others who may try to read or adapt to another project. The CRUD Python module could possible be adapted to may other CRUD systems. The advantage of working the module in this way was to not have to call any of the CRUD functions into the .ipynb file where it may could possibly make the .ipynb seem more cluttered. The CRUD module helps with the idea of modularized code and abstraction, an OOP principle. The CRUD Python module could be adapted to other software applications that may require CRUD functionality.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

I approach a problem as a computer scientist systematically with determination. I try to eliminate variables that are causing the issue. For example, in the .ipynb I could not get the Pie chart to appear. So in steps, I read through the code over again, I made sure variables and ID's matched in app.callbacks, and checked to make sure I was returning the dcc.graph correctly. It was a tedious process, but once I was able to see where I had gone wrong - I knew my approach had worked. My approach differed in this project from previous courses because it was working with concrete, real data. I knew that if something wasn't going to be coded correctly, it was not going to work, period. This made me approach the project by taking care in what I was naming different functions and variables to relate to the databse I was working with. I can use this technique in the future to create databases that will meet other client requests because it will help keep the consistency and reduce simple error.

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientists are plainy speaking problem solvers with computers. They take many complex issues and come up with solutions to fix or overcome these issues. This matters because it helps drive innovation of technology in all aspects - software and hardware, as well as other sectors(mechanical, electrical, chemical engineering). My work on this type of project would help a company do their work better by essentially keeping them organized and be able to easily understand their own system. If they have a better idea about how they run as a company, they can be more insightful as to what is working and what is not.
