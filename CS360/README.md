 Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

The requirements for this app were 2 database's - 1 for accounts and 1 for user data, the ability for the user to log in, and to allow the app to ask for (and send) SMS messages to notify the user for X condition (in my case, it was low inventory). The user needs this app was designed to address was to allow for organization, account security, and a database with CRUD (Create, read, update, delete) operations.

---------------
What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

Screens that were necessary were: a login screen, a create an account screen, a homepage, an add item screen, and an edit existing item screen. These in a nutshell were the necessary features that supported the user needs. I kept the users in mind by designing the app as if I was going to use it myself and understand where may a user find certain buttons. That, and I asked my wife for design input as for what made sense and what didn't. I felt this is what made my designs successful, as the live feedback proved very useful for the overall process.

-----------------
How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

I approached the coding of my app like most of my recent courses - iteration. Small chunks of code written or changed at a time, and compiling to see where I was at. At times, I would get a little zealous and do too much and crash the app and end up having to back track. I can still use this technique in the future, but I know I need to be more disciplined in not writing too much.

-----------------
How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

Just like I mentioned above, I would write code, compile, and try out whatever function I was trying to code at that moment. For the most part, it was very successful and Logcat was very helpful in chasing after run-time bugs and/or fatal errors. This process is important because an end-user is honestly expecting a bug-free experience, so a developer needs to be diligent in their testing to iron out all the flaws.  For me personally, it revealed that I have a real issue with refrencing null objects.

----------------
Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

Thinking about the project in its completeness, I realize I had to innovate the way the a user may edit an item. Instead of opening a completly new activitity, I essentially had a pop-up appear that the user could interact with. But to do this, I had to essentially create it's own class to generate the list of inventory items when populated.

----------------
In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

I think that the way I added items to a database demonstrated my knowledge and experience. Not only was I able to succesfully create a database, but I was able to create different methods that helped clean up my code and make it more readable. I even feel that if I went back to this project in a year, I would still be able to understand everything I wrote and pick up where I left off.
