 How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

  There are a few ways to ensure that any program, code, or software I am a part of or write myself is functional and secure. The number 1 way of doing this 
  would be testing! Throughout this course we explored different ways of testing code for a simple program, settling on JUnit tests to properly test and
  diagnose any issues. This was a very englightening process, as for each failed test it pointed in the correct direction of any errors to be fixed. This can
  help ensure the functionality and security of code by allowing to see the different possible runtime errors that may come up if the software were to be deployed.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

  I interpret user needs in a way of "user stories" like I had learned in CS250. As a developer, I would put myself in the users shoes and understand what I
  would like to see as far as features and results. Also, it helps me understand what is actually important to the end user. A user story is told from the
  perspective of the user, which is acts as a guide as to how to incorporate them into a program.

How do I approach designing software?

 I approach designing software wide-open throttle and lack of confidence. I have a picture in my head about how it is supposed to work and how it will work
 but I lack the experience needed to put those thoughts into action. As of lately, I do my best to take an interative approach and take it one line at a time,
 setting small but achieveable goals for myself.
