# SNHU_Portfolio_MJT
-----------------
A collection of all my assignments during the CS program. Some courses do not have all coursework that I have submitted, but still exist on my PC. With that being said:

Employers that wish to see anything specific while browsing this repository can ask and I will definitely send it their way!

Many files within each folder are given to use from SNHU, either incomplete or in whole, and it is our task as students to ensure they compile/run/operate correctly. With many files being word documents, I figured it important to include, not only for those to see publicly, but almost as a journal for myself of my time at Southern New Hampshire University. As of writing this, I am roughly 3 months away from completion and it has been a very difficult, fun, interesting, and challenging prorgam that I am very grateful for having been enrolled in.

A huge takeaway from the CS program is foundational knowledge that I know I can take with me anywhere. The one thing that I felt lacked from SNHU, and to no fault of their own, is the amount of one-on-one with the instructor. Of course, an online program of this nature can really only serve so much individual time with a student, but I know that is one aspect I wish I had. There are concepts I felt could have been taught better with a use of a great instructor, one who can explain these concepts on multiple levels for all types of students. Nevertheless, through the use of the internet, I know that answers to any questions I have are still out there and I will always continually be learning even after I finish the program.
