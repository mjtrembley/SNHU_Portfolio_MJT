Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
---
This project was based on creating a "smart thermostat" that could connect to a cloud server via wifi. It was a project based on a fictional company that wanted to break into smart home technology, where I as a developer was tasked with prototyping the thermostat.

What did you do particularly well?
---
I felt what I did particularly well was the coding aspect. I felt I met all requirements and within my scope of skills. I utilized resources given by the instructor and was able to successfully program a working "thermostat" that output data to a "server". I felt that my code was well commented, and had decent readability - given no professional experience.

Where could you improve?
---
I know I can improve on readability and formatting. At times I did feel my code was a little bit messy, but I know this will only get better with the more experience I obtain with software. Also, creating documentation I feel I could improve. I felt I don't have a grasp on writing and creating technical documents, but again: this is something I feel will come with time.

What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
---
The only tools/resources I figure I can add to my support network is technical manuals for microcontrollers. This gives a good idea of the capabilities and limitations to the microcontrollers used. I know that not every project is going to be an embedded system, but there are MANY oppurtunities where it just as well may be. Although this project just touched upon the deep world of embedded technologies, I know that in the future I may be referencing a technical manual a lot more than I think I will.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
---
More like what skills will NOT be transferable. I felt I used so many different skills ranging from attention to detail to critical thinking, and even some creativity to complete this project. Practicing these skills are incredibly important and I feel that they can help make a good developer great under certain circumstances.

How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
---
I made this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable by trying my best to comment on functions and variables, as well as data types. I tried to use macro's to improve readability, rather than using "magic numbers". I felt I did a successful job in doing this, because my wife (with no coding experience) could start to wrap her head around certain portions of code.
