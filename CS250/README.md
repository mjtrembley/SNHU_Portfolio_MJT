How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

  I believe a somewhat decent way of interpreting user needs is to put myself in the shoes of the user. As a user, what features and needs do I want to see?
  This is essentially a user story, "when I do this, so that I can do this". My own form of intepreting user needs of putting myself in their shoes is to understand
  what is important to an end user, and what just seems easy. It is frustrating to get lost in menus as a user. So it is in my best interest as a developer to prevent
  that for a satisfactory user experience. All in all, it seems the way I intepret user needs is a user story, because a user story is told from the perspective of
  the user.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

  Personally, I approach developing a program wide open and full of hesitancy. I never know where to start and it can be scary sometimes. The idea of agile
  and it's iterative approach sticks with me the most. I need to slow down and do small bits of at a time. Another process I wish to incorporate into my future development is
  story points. I really feel this is a helpful way to narrow down pieces of a project that can be brought together. As a beginner, I need practice and thus "the easy stuff".
  Although a challenge is always welcome, with developing some challenges are very intimidating.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

  To be a good team memeber in software development means communication, documentation, and a will to help. Communcation is very important in any relationship,
  especially within a team. Proper documentation, from comments in code to UML diagrams, it is important to paint a picture of the project. Documentation is really
  more aimed for the team/project overall, but all the same as an individual reponsible for it - it needs to be thoroughly spelled out. Lastly, having a will to help
  others is seemingly very important. I'm not in the field yet, but I can 100% see where a senior developer taking time out of their busy day to help a junior developer
  with an issue because they want to teach, rather than "our manager needs this fixed now", is helpful. Even as a junior developer, trying to put yourself out there
  and give any kind of insight or new perspective is helpful. In agile, everyone is responsible for the success (or failure) of the project.
