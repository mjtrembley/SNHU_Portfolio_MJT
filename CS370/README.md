Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

For this project, the vast majority of the code was supplied. This included a couple .py files, and a large chunk of the .ipynb file included in this repository. The code that I DID create for myself was essentially the actions that the pirate AI would take and learn from. With each epoch, the AI would be given a choice on which to move and would choose the move with the highest reward. It would then store this move for future moves to learn from. After which storing the experiences, the win percentage would be continually updated.

What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

Computer scientists use technology and software to solve a wide vareity of problems. This is important because a lot of human error can be taken out of the equation, such as data science applications where mathemetical equations may be in heavy use. Human error can create issues of different types, so the fact that computer scientists solve many problems with the technology available to them is incredible. And if the technology is not available, some even innovate the next generation to solve previously unsolvable issues.

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

As a computer scientist, I approach problems analyticly and with a mindset of "How will I solve this?" as opposed to something like "I'll never figure this one out". I do my best to take it in small bites, and work up to the larger issue at hand. In prior classes, I would divide larger projects into much smaller goals, that way I can keep track of my own progress and provide myself with milestones.

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

My ethical responsibilites to the end user and the organization is to handle data appropiately, safely, and securely. Every end-user and organization has very private information that is not for the public eyes, and it is and will be my duty as an engineer to uphold security in dealings with large amounts of data.
