 Coursework from CS210
 ---------------------
 Submitted by me, Matthew Trembley, for Southern New Hampshire University
----------------------
I have chosen to upload project 3 for CS210 at Southern New Hampshire University. This project has been
incredibly informative, both for myself as a beginning programmer and as myself as a student.

#Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
Project 3 is basic grocery tracking application, which takes a list of items bought and outputs the number of times.
There are 4 menu options: See full list of items bought, See specific item and # of times it was bought, Output of histogram of # times every item was bought
and lastly, exit.

#What did you do particularly well?
I feel what I did particularly well is handle user input and validate input, where I would print an error message if something was not correct.
I also feel that I formatted the output of the option 1 and 2 nicely and straight forward. Although I know it could be better - for a beginnier I have to say not too bad!

#Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I know I could enhance my code in the menu. If the user were to enter a string instead of an integer in the first menu, it sends the program into an infinite loop.
I'm not entirely sure why it did this, but I would be interested in finding out how to fix it. This would make it more efficient, as it could handle more than if the user
entered a number NOT 1 through 4.

#Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The pieces of code I found the most challenging to write was probably trying to count each occurrence of each item and add it to a list. Thankfully, while searching how to do this
I came across the Python function Counter. This takes a list, converts it to a dictionary where it enters each item as a key and the # times it occurred as the matching value.
This was probably the most helpful piece of information, as it made the rest of the project fly by. Other than that, iterating through the list in C++ to make the correct output
in option number 3 was probably the next hardest thing I had to do. My biggest resource was honestly intensively searching StackOverflow.com. This was an amazing resource with
real answers to some of the more specific questions I had.

#What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
Critical thinking and probelm solving are the two skills from the project that will transfer not just to other projects and course work, but my whole life!
These are two super important skills that I feel everyone should fine-tune. The project really made me think every step through, and have a plan to go about it. And when
a problem arose - I had to figure it out myself. This is the benefit of being online, too. I can't rely on a classmate sitting next to me - I have to actively seek out the
correct answer.

#How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I feel I made this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable by my comments. I tried to add comments that explained my thought process for each function, variable, and output.
I hope if anyone were to take over this project, they could easily expand on it, or even just improve it. The name of my variables and functions I thought were straight-forward as
well.
