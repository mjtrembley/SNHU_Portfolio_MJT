 How do I approach designing software?
What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
What design process did you follow for your project work?
How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

I approach designing software with an open mind that it will not be perfect the first 50 or 100 times in a row. It is a careful approach, with mindfullness that in the grand picture of it all, I still am very new to all this. The new design skills that the work on my project helped me craft would be organized and readable code, which is a very important skill to gain. I can apply this by forming it into a very good habit that will only improve my code from a professional standpoint.

How do I approach developing programs?
What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
How did iteration factor into your development?
How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

I approach developing progarms with an iterative mindset and a willingness to overcome obstacles. I don't let small (or large) things keep me down, I keep trying and I really have spent HOURS trying to figure out problems. With that being said, iteration factored into my development by being a monumental part of it. There would be times I wrote a couple lines and would compile to make sure I didn't break code. Or when positioning objects, there were times where I would move it .005 on an axis at a time or rotate an object from 20* - 30* just to see what seemed more realistic, while running the progam every single time I changed a small amount. My approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones by understanding what worked in each assignmetn and milestone and transfering it to my project. It was a lot of work, but in the end it was well worth it.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

Computer science can help me reach my goals, education and career, by improving skills like critical thinking and problem solving. These are core skills that seem very useful among other developers, and both of these can be applied to my future education and career. This course honed my patience, my desire to learn more in the CS world, and an excitement for things to come wherever my career/education takes me.
