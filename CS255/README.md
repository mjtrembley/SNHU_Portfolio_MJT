Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

  The DriverPass Project was a created scenario where the owner of the company, DriverPass, wanted to provide a service of driving lessons and online practice exams
  to help people pass their Driver's Education tests. They wanted a system that could help organize all this information, as well as allow for purchases to be made
  for certain "packages".

What did you do particularly well?

  I felt what I did particulary well was the business requirements document. I felt like I got all the big ticket items that allowed for a safe program. I 
  accounted for security as well as performance, which I feel the balance is very important.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

  If I could choose one part of my work, it would be a tie between my class diagram or my sequence diagrams. For this, I'll say my sequence diagrams.
  I feel that I missed a lot of "steps", but I had the overall idea. I just wasn't sure how exact I was supposed to be.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

  I intepreted the user's need essentially by putting myself in the user shoes. What would a user want to see? What would a user want in terms of security? It is
  important to consider the user's needs when designing because it is ulitmately them that is using the program. They have to deal with the headache when it isn't responding
  or working with their current browser, so on and so forth.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

  I approached designing this software with a lot of refelction on the interview transcript. Although SNHU sets you up for success in the design of the software, 
  it being my first time it was a bit overwhelming. I referenced a lot of examples to help me with the design, in my textbook and google searching. Going forward, I would
  probably continue to reference other examples to help me design a proper program.
