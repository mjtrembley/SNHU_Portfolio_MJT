Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

  The client was The Gaming Room, who had a game application "Draw It or Lose It", based around a TV show game in the 1980's. The were intersted in expanding
  this gaming application to multiple different platforms. They asked for an evaluation of three operating platforms to showcase how the game application 
  could be deployed.
***************************************************************************
What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

  I felt what I did particulary well within developing the documentation was give concise answers and straight to the point. I feel that as I was fictionally being 
  contracted to write it, the fictional client deserved straight answers.
***************************************************************************
What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

  What I found the most helpful was the UML diagrams. It was a reminder of what the endgame goals were and gave insight into how to achieve them.
*************************************************************************** 
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

  If I could choose one part of my work to revise, it would most likely be the comparison chart of different operating systems. I felt like that was my weakest
  section, and it was the one part that gave solid answers, but not much to support those answers. To improve it, I would give some more information, but not too
  much, as I do not want to overload the client with information they may not need.
***************************************************************************
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

  I interpreted the user's needs as if I was one that was going to use the software. As an end user myself, it is important for a software to have certain criteria 
  to meet my own personal standards. I tried to implement this into my own design by mimicking myself and what I would see fit for the design. It is important to 
  consider the user's needs when designing because not all end users are running on the same system.
***************************************************************************
How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

  I approached desginging software with a mindfulness of the end user. Although most of the program was written me and supplied by SNHU, it was important that I read through
  the code and took in how it was written on a understanding level, this way I can look back on it and work through future projects with the same understanding.
